## Project task
This is a personal project of mine done as a practice to shape up my design and development skills. I've used an existing outdated website as a reference and tried to make a new and improved version of it (freshen the page up a bit). Mock client is a stone producing and proccesing company who wants a simple website showing some of their info and their products.

## Project overview
All of the project was done in a few days time (3-4 hours each day) with design time included. I went for a modern white and black looking website with splashes of different colors here and there. I didn't run into any problems all of it was pretty standard HTML and CSS with some JavaScript for navigation. Website consist of few pages (materials, products, clients and contact) where information about certain area are displayed. Website is responsive and nice looking on all devices and I'm satisfied with how it turned out.

There are some fixes to be done though specifically with some minor issues on mobile navigation and localization is to be added.
